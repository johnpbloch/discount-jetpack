= Discount Jetpack

Remove the annoying 'new module' count from the Jetpack menu in WordPress.

I use Jetpack for a limited number of modules and hate seeing the "Update" counters in the menu for modules I'm aware of and [chose never to activate](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/manual-control/). So I made a very basic plugin that fixes the issue.
